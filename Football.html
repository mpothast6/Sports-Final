            <h1>All you need to know about Football!</h1>
            <p>American football developed in the late 19th century, evolving from rugby and soccer. The first organized college games took place in the 1860s–70s, with rule changes led by Walter Camp, known as the “Father of American Football.” Over time, the sport grew in popularity due to its strategy, physicality, and team coordination. In 1920, the NFL was created, transforming football into one of the most watched and celebrated sports in the United States. Today, football is known for its explosive plays, tactical depth, and passionate fan culture across all levels—from youth leagues to the Super Bowl.</p>

<p><strong>Football Rules:</strong></p>
<li>Each team has 11 players on the field at a time.</li>
<li>The main objective is to score points by advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone for a touchdown.</li>
<li>The offense can move the ball by running plays or passing plays; the defense tries to stop them.</li>
<li>A standard game has four 15-minute quarters (NFL and college).</li>
<li><strong>Downs system:</strong> The offense has four downs to advance the ball 10 yards; if successful, they earn a new set of downs.</li>
<li><strong>Penalties:</strong> (holding, offsides, pass interference, etc.) result in yardage gains or losses depending on the infraction.</li>
<li><strong>Field goals:</strong> are worth 3 points and occur when the offense kicks the ball through the uprights.</li>
<li><strong>Turnovers:</strong> such as interceptions or fumbles give possession to the opposing team.</li>
