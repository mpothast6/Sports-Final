            <h1>All you need to know about Soccer!</h1>
<p>Soccer, also known as football in most parts of the world, originated in England in the mid-19th century. While different cultures played early versions of kicking games, the modern rules were standardized in 1863 when the Football Association was formed in London. The sport quickly spread worldwide because it required minimal equipment and could be played almost anywhere. In 1904, FIFA was founded to organize international competition, and the first World Cup was held in 1930. Today, soccer is the most popular sport in the world, uniting countries, cultures, and fans through competition and teamwork.</p>
<p><strong> Soccer Rules:</strong></p>   
<li>Each team has 11 players on the field (10 field players + 1 goalkeeper).</li>   
<li>The main objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s net.</li>  
<li>Players cannot use their hands or arms, except the goalkeeper inside the penalty area.</li> 
<li>A match is usually 90 minutes long, split into two 45-minute halves.</li> 
<li><strong>Offside rule:</strong> A player cannot receive the ball behind the last defender unless they were onside when the pass was made.</li> 
<li><strong>Fouls:</strong> (pushing, tripping, handballs, etc.) result in free kicks or penalty kicks.</li> 
<li><strong>Corner kicks:</strong> are awarded when the defending team last touches the ball before it crosses the goal line.</li> 
<li><strong>Foul Cards:</strong>Yellow cards are given as warnings, and red cards are given for serious fouls and result in immediate ejection from the match.</li>
